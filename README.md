# Starshine

A space for distraction-free writing. Can there be 'spaces' on the web? I suppose I could describe this as a RESTful writing app, built with the MERN stack... but I think it's nice to think of it as a writing space.

## Motivation

Ever need a place to write without ads? Some place with few distractions and a minimal UI? Well, look no further!

Starshine is a writing app for quick projects (think nanowrimo) where writers can express themselves without the distraction of layouts or ads.
